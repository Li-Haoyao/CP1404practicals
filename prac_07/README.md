Lessons Learned about Clean Code
Throughout this subject, I have learned several key lessons about writing clean, maintainable code:
Use meaningful names: Variable, function, and class names should clearly describe their purpose.
Keep functions small and focused: Each function should do one job well, making it easier to test and debug.
Follow consistent style and formatting: Proper indentation, spacing, and naming conventions improve readability.
Avoid code duplication: Use loops, functions, or inheritance to reuse logic instead of repeating code.
Write helpful comments and docstrings: They make your code understandable for both yourself and others.
